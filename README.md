# mobile_computing_web_app

Simple adaptive web app for my Mobile Computing exam

This app can generate a random palette with three colors. It uses CSS-Media Queries to achive the adaptivity for large screens, small screens and mobile devices.

It uses the accelerometer via HTTP5 on mobile devises - shaking of the device will generate a new color palette.
